# RedStream

## Note to all Students: 
This project was used for the final assignment in CSCB58 at the University of Toronto. **I have shared the GitHub link to the code with the instructors**. If you happen to come accross this code, do **NOT** use this for your own project. You are free to look at the code (I cannot stop you), and learn from it but do not copy-paste any of the code here. As a piece of advice from another student, plagirism is not the answer no matter how much you are struggling, the instructors will find out through their own plagarism checks. 

## Necessary Software
This project uses the MARS Assembly software available at http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/mars/.

## Demo
A video demoing this project can be seen at https://youtu.be/Q6O_1jH5Khk.

## Description
This is a spaceship game coded in assembly, I call it "Red Stream". It was used for the final assignment in CSCB58 at the University of Toronto and was recognized as one of the best projects in the semester. The final mark for this project 106.67%.

In the game you are the fighter jet which is named "Red Stream" and your goal is to survive an endless onslaught of asteroids. As the game progresses you encounter pickups such as the life and bonus points. The game increases in difficulty as it continues by increasing the speed of the asteroids and reducing spawning of the pickups. Good luck survivng! ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž

Features Implemented
- Increasing Diffuculty
- Health and bonus points pickup
- Score system
- Health bar
- Key controls to interact with game(refer to How To Play)
- Smooth graphics (done by redrawing parts of the asteroids instead of the full asteroid)
- Welcome and Game Over screens
- Collisions show in place of contact instead of one generic location

The code is well documented and the video demo goes over any parts I view as confusing. 

## How to Play
<ol>
<li>Run the game to get to the welcome screen! Press any key to start. <img src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53048085/129650094-fce16fbb-1192-4e3e-9dfc-fb56db2ce09a.png"/></li>
  
<li>Navigate the ship using the W (up), A (left), S (down), D (right) keys. <img src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53048085/129650406-589bcd30-5af8-43bd-a09a-c35165accf9c.png"/></li>
  
<li>There are three other key controls while playing. Press p to restart, press o to go back to the welcome screen, press i to go directly to the game over screen. </li>
  
<li>Note that at the game over screen you have two options, press p to go to the welcome screen or any other key to terminate the program. </li>
  
<li>Navigate and avoid the asteroids while picking up the pickups. Life = 20% of health back and Bonus Points = 50 points. </li>
  
<li>Have fun playing the game and good luck surviving! ðŸš€ðŸš€ </li>
